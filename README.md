# Book Recommendation App
The Book Recommendation App is a mobile application developed as part of my semester project for mobile application development. It is designed to assist users in finding their next read. It employs advanced techniques such as Popularity-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering to offer personalized book suggestions, enhancing the reading experience for users. The app addresses the challenge of information overload by providing tailored recommendations, thus streamlining the book selection process for users.
